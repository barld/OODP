In the previous weeks, the teacher files covered all details of certain concepts that are found in the class assignments. For interfaces, I decided to try something different and focus more on the 'why' behind the concept.

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can igore the .sln and .csproj files; just download the CS files and run them as separate projects. You can remove the namespaces as well.
If you use Visual Studio, you can download the files and put them in the same structure as they have been committed to GitHub. Then the IDE lets you choose which namespace to run through a dropdown menu at the top of the screen.
