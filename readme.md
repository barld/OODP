# OODP

## General Information
This course, Object Oriented Design & Programming (OODP), will introduce you to the concepts of object-oriented programming, including its four design pillars: Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Abstraction. It will also cover advanced programming concepts such as recursion and higher-order functions.

In the first three weeks of the course, you will learn the basics of the C# language the key differences with Python. You will then create and use methods, classes, and lists, and apply these skills in the Mini Project of the course Project B.

After the Mini Project, you will study the object-oriented design pillars, as well as collections, file and exception handling, and data persistence using JSON.

The latter half of the course will expand your skills and prepare you for the next year of study. You will cover advanced topics such as generics, collections, data persistence, higher-order functions, recursion, exception handling, and unit testing.
