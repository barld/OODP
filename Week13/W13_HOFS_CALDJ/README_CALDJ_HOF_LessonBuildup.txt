Lesson 1:
PART1:

Used Buildup from Development 2. Development 2 was in Python. 
Deborah made power point about HOFs then, they are nice, but they are in Python, so I will skip most, will just show a few. Let me know if you want to know which ones I use.

 - create draw function that draws triangle, then a square, then another shape, just by changing the condition 
		=> code repetition


 - show that to prevent code repetition, we can do one HOF that takes a function as input and returns another a draw function.

PART2:

From here introduce lambdas and actions. They are useful because then we don't need to store a function in a method before passing it as a parameter: we can pass it as a parameter without storing it, making it anonymous and a lot more handy.

PART3: 
Then explain currying (with Methods only, then with Lambdas)

PART4: 

Later solve together the  MAP, FILTER, Reduce :
 - first with strings then generic 
 - Reduce is hard with generics so avoid doing Reduce with Generics, because class gets very heavy
 - Show the image with the fruits, with Map Filter and Reduce.

After explaing MAP and Filter And Reduce, the buildup for LINQ is very easy.




Lesson 2:


Exercise exercise exercise

MAP, Filter, Reduce => if no time in previous lesson

HOFs with Recursion => a few examples, use the recursive Filter Exercises that is in codegrade and solve it together.
